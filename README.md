## :memo: Description
The ECOSModeling 2.0 tool is an evolution of the ECOSModeling web tool, an environment that allows performing the modeling of Software Ecosystems (SECO) using the SSN notation, in addition to the maintenance and evolution of SECO models.

## :books: Functionalities
* <b>Modeling </b>: It allows the export of the model created in some extensions, both as an image (PNG) as well as in JSON and XML formats. This functionality allows the user to later use the model created in the tool.

* <b>Export model </b>: It allows the export of the model created in some extensions, both as an image (PNG) as well as in JSON and XML formats. This functionality allows the user to later use the model created in the tool.

* <b>Import model </b>: It allows the import of the model in XML format in the tool for maintenance and subsequent evolution, such as the addition of new components and relationships to SECO.

* <b>internationalization </b>: Enables the internationalization of the tool. The functionality allows the translation of the tool in three languages: Portuguese, English and Spanish.

* <b>mMnipulate model </b>: Series of functionalities that help in the creation of the model, its structuring and subsequent maintenance and evolution. The manipulation functionalities are: zoom in and out, standard zoom, delete component, cut, copy, paste, redo, undo, select all and deselect, print, component forward, backward, bold, italic and underline. 
 
* <b>Properties </b>: The functionality displays the XML properties of the model created at the time of modeling to the user. This functionality allows you to view the properties of the model.

* <b>Statistics </b>: The functionality generates a statistical report of the model, on the SECO components and relationships. The functionality allows the extraction of data for future quantitative analysis of the model, evolution, versions and maintenance.
